Construction Zone
=============================================

Construction Zone is an open-source Python package designed as a tool to help
build and generate complex nanoscale atomic models. The package was designed with
simulation workflows, like TEM and MD simulations, and machine learning pipelines in mind.
Its interface is flexible and allows for easy development of progammatic constructions
that are suitable for applications in materials science, and much of the bookkeeping
typically required when making complex atomic objects is abstracted from the user.
